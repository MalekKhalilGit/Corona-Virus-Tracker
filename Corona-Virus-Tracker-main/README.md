# Corona-Virus-Tracker
Application that tracks the reported cases of Corona and refreshs once a day.
I used: 
-Spring Boot (Maven) with the Spring Web extention and the Thymeleaf extention
-Bootstrap
-CSV database
The data is from a CSV database that gets actualized daily.
The website shows the number of corona cases world wide and the number of cases in each contry and state at this date.
It shows the number of new cases since the previous day world wide and in each contry and state.
