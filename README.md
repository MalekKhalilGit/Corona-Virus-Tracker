# Corona-Virus-Tracker
Application that tracks the reported cases of Corona and refreshs once a day.
The application keeps track of changes in the infection rates all across the globe.
I used Java, Boot Strap, csv, ThymeLeaf, Spring Boot for this application.
The application accesses a database that gets refreshed daily for the information needed and 
displays it in a custom table.
